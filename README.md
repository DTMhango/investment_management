#### Basic Investment Management Application

This project is an Investment management tool for fund managers to monitor their clients. The project consists of three models: Client, Contribution and Investment.

##### Client:

The client model represents the clients that are managed by the application. This comprises client personal information and additional details such as reasons for investing, target returns and methods of investing - regular periodic installments or lump-sum investments.

##### Contribution:

The contribution model represents the funds the client provides the investment/fund manager to manage. This model tracks the amount provided by the client, the date the payment was made and fund manager responsible for the client's funds.

##### Investment:

The investment model tracks what the manager does with the funding once it is received. This model also tracks the expected return from the date of investment based on the fund manager's initial expectations. These initial parameters are tracked throughout the life of the investment and are not editable. The goal is to provide a comparative of the final actual investment returns vs the initial projected expectations.
